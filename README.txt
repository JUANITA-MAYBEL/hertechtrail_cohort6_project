JUANITA'S PORTFOLIO:

HOME: 

This is the main entry point or the first page that visitors see when they visit my website. It serves as a 
central hub that introduces me, my work, and sets the tone for the entire website. The home page plays a crucial role 
in capturing the attention of visitors, providing an overview of my portfolio, and guiding them to explore further.

ABOUT:

The About page serves as a space to provide visitors with more detailed information about myself, my background, and 
my professional journey. It offers an opportunity to share my story, showcase my expertise, and establish a personal 
connection with potential clients, collaborators, or employers. The About page helps visitors understand who I am 
beyond my work and provides context for my portfolio.

PORTFOLIO:

The Portfolio page serves as a showcase of my work, accomplishments, and expertise. It is a dedicated section where I can 
present a curated selection of my best projects. The primary purpose of this portfolio page is to demonstrate my skills,
creativity, and professional capabilities to potential clients, collaborators, or employers. Each page is detailed. 
When you click on each of the projects, it takes you live to give more details about my capabilities. 

CONTACT:

The contact page is an avenue to enable visitors to ask questions, seek information about my services, or discuss 
potential projects by using the form provided. It has my social media handles, emails, phone numbers and residential 
address. 


It looks great on all devices from mobile to desktop. It's also retina ready so your sight will look 
crisp and sharp on any device used.
