This is Juanita's portfolio website. It has many cool features found
in premium templates. It has timeline items, skillbars, working ajax form,
frontend form validation, a portfolio section to showcase my works, a contact page which allows employers 
send a feed back and an about page that gives tangible information about me. It looks 
great on all devices from mobile to desktop. It's also retina ready so your site will look 
crisp and sharp on any device.
